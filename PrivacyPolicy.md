## Collection of Information

We do not collect any user information. This includes but is not limited to: your browsing history, traffic destination, data content, DNS queries, IP addresses, timestamps, session duration, bandwidth usage, or server locations.

Our application is designed with a strict no-log policy. As such, we do not have access to any data regarding the websites you visit or the applications you use while connected to our VPN service.

We ensure these logs are properly secured and regularly purged to further safeguard your privacy.
